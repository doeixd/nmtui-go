# nmtui-go Changes Summary

This document outlines all the changes made to the nmtui-go project during development.

## Phase 1: Unified Network List

### Unified Network List
- Combined separate known networks and scanned networks into a single unified list
- Networks are now displayed together with indicators for known (★) and active (✔) status
- Simplified the UI by removing separate views for known vs. scanned networks
- Updated sorting to prioritize: Active networks → Known networks → Available networks by signal strength
- **Note**: Out-of-range known networks only display if they are currently active (not showing inactive known networks that are out of range)

## Phase 2: Initial Feature Implementation (Caching & Scanning Indicator)

### Caching System
- Added `cacheFile` constant (`/tmp/nmtui-cache.json`) for storing scanned networks
- Created `loadCachedNetworks()` function to load cached networks on application startup
- Created `saveCachedNetworks()` function to save networks after successful scans
- Modified `initialModel()` to load cached networks at startup for instant display

### Scanning Indicator
- Modified `headerView()` to display a spinner between "Network Manager" and "Wi-Fi:<status>" when scanning

## Phase 3: Bug Fixes (Network Disappearing During Scan)

### Network Persistence During Scanning
- Removed conditional hiding of network list when `isLoading=true` in the `View()` function
- Modified `wifiListLoadedMsg` handler to ignore empty scan results and keep `isScanning=true`
- Modified `knownNetworksMsg` handler to preserve cached networks during scanning state
- Removed `m.processAndSetWifiList([])` call that was clearing networks on refresh

## Phase 4: Code Cleanup & Quality Improvements

### Removed Unused Code
- Deleted `knownWifiApsListMsg` type
- Removed `connectionProfileToWifiAP()` function
- Removed `fetchKnownWifiApsCmd()` function

### Fixed Lint Warnings
- Removed redundant nil checks
- Eliminated redundant state condition checks in `View()` switch statement

### UI Fixes
- Fixed signal strength display from double percent signs (`%%`) to single (`%`)

## Phase 5: Documentation Updates

### README.md Changes
- Removed GitHub release badges and links
- Added Go 1.21+ requirement
- Replaced installation section with "Building from Source" instructions
- Removed "Release Process" section about GoReleaser
- Added credit note acknowledging `doeixd` as the original creator with a link to their repository

## Additional Features

### Network Deduplication
- Implemented deduplication of networks by SSID, keeping the one with the strongest signal
- Modified `getAllWifiItems()` to consolidate duplicate access points
- Updated filtering logic to work with deduplicated list

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed filtering during scanning/refreshing**: Custom filtering logic now works properly when pressing `/` during scanning or refreshing operations, instead of triggering Bubble Tea's built-in list filtering

## Technical Improvements
- **Unified list**: Single network list combining known and scanned networks with clear status indicators
- **Network caching**: Instant startup with previously scanned networks
- **Persistent display**: Networks remain visible during the entire scan cycle (15-second process)
- **Deduplication**: Networks with same SSID show as one entry with strongest signal
- **Clean codebase**: No lint warnings, no unused code
- **Better UX**: Scanning indicator, correct signal display, build-from-source focus
- **Custom filtering**: Real-time SSID filtering with filtered count display

All changes were validated through compilation and testing. The project now provides a robust TUI for WiFi management with caching, persistent display during scans, and clean code.
